# RestAPIsLearning

In this repo we just learned about the rest APIs.

1.When you make the any model then you have to migrate them to display in the database. For that we have to write this code. : "python manage.py makemigrations" and then "python manage.py migrate"

2.We make the serializer to display the Different model data in the JSON format.
